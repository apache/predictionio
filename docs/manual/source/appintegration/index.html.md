title: App Integration Overview

Apache PredictionIO (incubating) is designed as a machine learning server that
integrates with your applications on production environments.

A web or mobile app normally:

1.  Send event data to Apache PredictionIO (incubating)'s Event Server for model
    training
2.  Send dynamic queries to deployed engine(s) to retrieve predicted results

## Sending Event Data

Apache PredictionIO (incubating)'s Event Server receives event data from your
application. The data can be used by engines as training data to build preditive
models.

Event Server listens to port 7070 by default. You can change the port with the
[--port arg](/cli/#event-server-commands) when you launch the Event Server.

For further information, please read:

* [Event Server Overview](/datacollection/)
* [Collecting Data with REST/SDKs](/datacollection/eventapi)

## Sending Query

After you deploy an engine as a web service, it will wait for queries from your
application and return predicted results in JSON format.  An engine listens to
port 8000 by default. If you want to deploy multiple engines, you can specific a
different port for each of them.
