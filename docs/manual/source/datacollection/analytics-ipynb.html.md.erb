title: Machine Learning Analytics with IPython Notebook
---

[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is a very powerful
interactive computational environment, and with
[Apache PredictionIO (incubating)](http://predictionio.incubator.apache.org),
[PySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) and [Spark
SQL](https://spark.apache.org/sql/), you can easily analyze your collected
events when you are developing or tuning your engine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the latest stable IPython installed,
and that the command `ipython` can be accessed from your shell's search path.

<%= partial 'shared/datacollection/parquet' %>

## Preparing IPython Notebook

Launch IPython Notebook with PySpark using the following command, with
`$SPARK_HOME` replaced by the location of Apache Spark.

```
$ PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS="notebook --pylab inline" $SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark
```

By default, you should be able to access your IPython Notebook via web browser
at http://localhost:8888.

Let's initialize our notebook for the following code in the first cell.

```python
import pandas as pd
def rows_to_df(rows):
    return pd.DataFrame(map(lambda e: e.asDict(), rows))
from pyspark.sql import SQLContext
sqlc = SQLContext(sc)
rdd = sqlc.parquetFile("/tmp/movies")
rdd.registerTempTable("events")
```

`rows_to_df(rows)` will come in handy when we want to dump the results from
Spark SQL using IPython Notebook's native table rendering.

## Performing Analysis with Spark SQL

If all steps above ran successfully, you should have a ready-to-use analytics
environment by now. Let's try a few examples to see if everything is functional.

In the second cell, put in this piece of code and run it.

```python
summary = sqlc.sql("SELECT "
                   "entityType, event, targetEntityType, COUNT(*) AS c "
                   "FROM events "
                   "GROUP BY entityType, event, targetEntityType").collect()
rows_to_df(summary)
```

You should see the following screen.

We can also plot our data, in the next two cells.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
count = map(lambda e: e.c, summary)
event = map(lambda e: "%s (%d)" % (e.event, e.c), summary)
colors = ['gold', 'lightskyblue']
plt.pie(count, labels=event, colors=colors, startangle=90, autopct="%1.1f%%")
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
```

![Summary in Pie Chart](/images/datacollection/ipynb-03.png)

```python
ratings = sqlc.sql("SELECT properties.rating AS r, COUNT(*) AS c "
                   "FROM events "
                   "WHERE properties.rating IS NOT NULL "
                   "GROUP BY properties.rating "
                   "ORDER BY r").collect()
count = map(lambda e: e.c, ratings)
rating = map(lambda e: "%s (%d)" % (e.r, e.c), ratings)
colors = ['yellowgreen', 'plum', 'gold', 'lightskyblue', 'lightcoral']
plt.pie(count, labels=rating, colors=colors, startangle=90,
        autopct="%1.1f%%")
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
```

Happy analyzing!
