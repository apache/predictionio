## What is PredictionIO?

PredictionIO is an **open source Machine Learning Server** built on top of state-of-the-art open source stack for developers and data scientists create predictive engines for any machine learning task. It lets you:

* quickly build and deploy an engine as a web service on production with [customizable templates](http://templates.prediction.io);
* respond to dynamic queries in **real-time** once deployed as a web service;
* evaluate and tune multiple engine variants systematically;
* unify data from multiple platforms in batch or in real-time for comprehensive predictive analytics;
* speed up machine learning modeling with systematic processes and pre-built evaluation measures;
* support machine learning and data processing libraries such as Spark MLLib and OpenNLP;
* implement your own machine learning models and seamlessly incorporate them into your engine;
* simplify data infrastructure management.

PredictionIO can be [installed](https://docs.prediction.io/install/) as a full machine learning stack, bundled with **Apache Spark**, **MLlib**, **HBase**, **Spray** and **Elasticsearch**, which simplifies and accelerates scalable machine learning infrastructure management.
