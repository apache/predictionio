## Prerequisites

It is **very important** to meet the minimum version of the following
technologies that power Apache PredictionIO®.

* Apache Hadoop 2.6.5 (optional, required only if YARN and HDFS are needed)
* Apache Spark 2.0.2 for Hadoop 2.6
* Java SE Development Kit 8

and one of the following sets:

* PostgreSQL 9.1

or

* MySQL 5.1

or

* Apache HBase 0.98.5
* Elasticsearch 1.7.6

WARNING: **Note that support for Scala 2.10 and Spark 1.6 were removed as of PredictionIO 0.14.0.
Note that support for Elasticsearch 1 is deprecated as of PredictionIO 0.14.0.**

If you are running on a single machine, we recommend a minimum of 2GB memory.

INFO: If you are using Linux, Apache Spark local mode, which is the default
operation mode without further configuration, may not work. In that case,
configure your Apache Spark to run in [standalone cluster
mode](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).

## Installation

WARNING: **0.8.2 contains schema changes from the previous versions, if you have
installed the previous versions, you may need to clear both HBase and
Elasticsearch. See more [here](/resources/upgrade/).**
